			<h3>A Brazilian asks for Help</h3>
			<br>
			<span>Unfortunately, on this date (October 28, 2018) my country Brazil lost the fight against the fascism. Even with so much struggle, we lose, and what remains for us now is to try to flee against the barbaries that the future awaits us. I count on the collaboration of anyone, so that we can use this donation to escape the country. Eternally grateful.
